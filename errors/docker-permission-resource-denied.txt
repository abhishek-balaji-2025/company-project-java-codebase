# If your Jenkins agent on the slave node is running as the ubuntu user (which is common on AWS EC2 Ubuntu servers).

# Hereâ€™s the exact process:

# Run the command on the slave node:
sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu

# Reboot the slave node (or log out and back in) so group changes take effect:
sudo reboot

# Verify membership after reboot:
getent group

# You should see docker in the list.

# Test Docker without sudo:
docker ps

# If you see running containers (or an empty list without errors), the fix worked.
